					We invite applications for a 2 years post-doctoral position in hybrid MHD-particle modelisation of solar eruptive events and of their propagation. The position could be extended by one extra year.

					The position is funded through the STORMGENESIS project that aims at characterizing the initiation, propagation and connectivity of solar storms based on innovative and ambitious numerical modelling combined to latest space weather observations. Our goal is to answer the following questions, in the context of Solar Orbiter: How do transients drive heliospheric variability? How do coronal mass ejections (CMEs) transport magnetic field and solar material into the heliosphere? How do solar eruptions produce energetic particles radiation that fills the heliosphere? In order to answer these questions, the scientific objectives of STORMGENESIS are to:

					1.	Model CMEs from their initiation to their propagation up to the Earth orbit
					2.	Unveil the connectivity of CMEs in the heliosphere 
					3.	Characterize particle acceleration at all stages of evolution

					The offered position will tackle objectives 1 and 3 primarily. The hired postdoc researcher will be expected to 

					•	Develop 3D numerical models of eruptive active regions based on a hybrid MHD+PIC code including the feedback of accelerated particles on the bulk fluid. 
					•	Perform numerical simulations of propagating CME in the heliosphere using adaptive mesh refinement (based on models developed in Regnault et al. 2022) including the acceleration of test particles computed on the fly as the simulation progresses. 
					•	Lead the writing and publication process of scientific papers and the presentation of the results in national and international conferences

					As a result, the scientific expertise of the candidate should be among the following fields: hybrid fluid-particle modelisation, MHD, solar eruptions, CMEs, Space Weather, high performance computing. The candidate will use the versatile hybrid code PLUTO, since initial setups for the two main projects listed above have already been developed by A. Strugarek with this code. Other numerical tools could be also considered depending on the experience of the hired. 
					The position will be held in Département d’Astrophysique (DAp), CEA Paris-Saclay (France) in close collaboration with researchers at Université Paris-Saclay (M. Janvier, E. Buchlin at IAS). DAp is a world-class astrophysical and space science department with more than 150 faculty and staff members, variously studying stellar evolution and dynamics, astrophysical fluid dynamics, planets and stars formation, multi-wavelength astronomy, cosmology, high energy astrophysics. DAp is located about 15 km south of Paris (near Orsay). The hired postdoc researcher will be supervised by A. Strugarek (P.I. of the STORMGENESIS project) and will collaborate closely with R. Pinto (Postdoc), A.S. Brun and B. Perri (freshly hired tenure researcher in our group). The hired postdoc researcher will have 15% of their time left for their own projects, and is expected to devote 85% of their research time to the STORMGENESIS project.

					Applicants should have a PhD in astrophysics or plasma physics by the time they start this postdoctoral position. The applicants should have an outstanding record of research and publications, some experience in managing small scientific projects on their own, and real interest in computational astrophysics and applied mathematics. Depending on experience, the candidate could be asked to help the PI co-supervise a PhD students hired within the STORMGENESIS project.

					This position funded for 2 years by the French ANR could be renewed for a third year depending on scientific progress and achievement. The gross minimum salary will be at 37,500€ annually (~2,450€ net per month), and will be adjusted to a higher value according to experience and family situation. A minimum of 3,000 € per year of travel money will also be provided, in addition to the usual funding support of any French institution. Applications are expected to be received before the 3rd of October 2022, and the selected candidate could start their position in December 2022 and no later than April 2023.  

					To apply, please send a resume, list of publications, statement of research interests and experience, and arrange for at least two letters of reference to be sent to Dr Antoine Strugarek (PI of the project STORMGENESIS, antoine.strugarek@cea.fr).
