						<p>We invite applications for a 2 years post-doctoral position in large-scale MHD modelling of dynamo action in Earth-like exoplanets with short-period orbit, to work with Dr. Antoine Strugarek (DAp-AIM, CEA) and Dr. Christophe Le Poncin-Lafitte (SYRTE, Observatoire de Paris). </p>
					</div>

					<div class="container">
					<p>	The position is funded through the <a href="http://www.dim-origines.fr">DIM Origines</a> program.</p> 
					
					<p>The hired postdoc researcher will be expected to </p>

					<ol>
						<li> Develop 3D numerical models of dynamo action in the internal layers of an Earth-like planet bathing in a strong ambient magnetic field. </li>
						<li> Implement planetary dynamo scaling-laws in the secular evolution ESPEM code, to model planet migration on close-in orbits due to magnetic torques. </li>
						<li> Lead the writing and publication process of scientific papers and the presentation of the results in national and international conferences</li>
					</ol>

					<p>As a result, the scientific expertise of the candidate should be among the following fields: dynamo action in celestial bodies, MHD, high performance computing, internal structure of exoplanets. The candidate will use the ASH and ESPEM codes, both developed in-house. Other numerical tools could be also considered depending on the experience of the hired. </p>

					<p>The position will be held in DÃ©partement d'Astrophysique (DAp-AIM), CEA Paris-Saclay (France) in close collaboration with C. Le Poncin-Lafitte at SYRTE, Paris Observatory. DAp-AIM is a world-class astrophysical and space science department with more than 150 faculty and staff members, variously studying solar physics, stellar evolution and dynamics, astrophysical fluid dynamics, planets and stars formation, multi-wavelength astronomy, cosmology, high energy astrophysics. DAp-AIM is located about 15 km south of Paris (near Orsay). The hired postdoc researcher will be supervised by A. Strugarek and will collaborate closely with A.S. Brun at DAp-AIM. The hired postdoc researcher will have 15% of their time left for their own projects, and is expected to devote 85% of their research time to the DynamEARTH project.</p>

					<p>Applicants should have a PhD in astrophysics or plasma physics by the time they start this postdoctoral position. The applicants should have an outstanding record of research and publications, some experience in managing small scientific projects on their own, and real interest in computational astrophysics and applied mathematics.</p>

					<p>To apply, please send a resume, list of publications, statement of research interests and experience, and arrange for at least two letters of reference to be sent to Dr Antoine Strugarek (<a href="mailto:antoine.strugarek@cea.fr">antoine.strugarek@cea.fr</a>).</p>
